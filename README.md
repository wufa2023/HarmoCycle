## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized to facilitate both tool usage and result reproduction:

```text
.
├── HarmoCycle/       # Source code for the Python package
├── Tutorial/         # Jupyter notebooks demonstrating basic usage
├── Experiment/       # Scripts for benchmarking against other methods (Fig 2)
├── FigurePlot/       # Notebooks for generating figures (Fig 1-7)
└── Dataset/          # Documentation on data sources and preprocessing
```

---

## 🛠️ Installation

HarmoCycle requires Python 3.8+ and PyTorch. We recommend using a Conda environment.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/TianLab-Bioinfo/HarmoCycle.git
cd HarmoCycle

# Create environment
conda create -n harmocycle python=3.8
conda activate harmocycle

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install the package
pip install .
```
